E-Commerce Customer Segmentation and High Value Customer prediction

### Overview
This project focuses on identifying meaningful customer segments and predicting churn behavior using machine learning techniques. It integrates clustering methods (RFM, K-Means, DBSCAN) and supervised models, with deployment strategies to visualize actionable insights for stakeholders.

---

### Features
- RFM-based segmentation analysis
- Clustering using K-Means and DBSCAN
- Churn prediction via supervised classification
- Power BI dashboard for visual insights

---

### Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Gradio
- Power BI
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

### Steps involved
1. Explore the Dataset
2. Conduct Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis 
3. Preprocessing Steps such as handling nulls, negative values,etc
4. Feature Engineering -> Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis
5. Customer Segmentation
6. Model Building
7. Evaluate and Compare Model Performance
8. Deployment and Visualization

---

### Results
- Segment "Loyal High-Spenders" showed lowest churn rate (3%)
- Early signs of churn detected with 89% model accuracy
- Dashboard enables stakeholder-driven exploration
